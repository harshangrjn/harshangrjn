### [Harsha Nagarajan](http://harshanagarajan.com)

I'm a staff scientist at the [Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/applied-mathematics-plasma-physics/index.php) group in [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov) (LANL). I am also part of the [Advanced Network Science Initiative](https://lanl-ansi.github.io) at LANL. 
I'm interested in development of efficient formulations and algorithms for modeling, design and control of complex physical systems. I also work on applications of MILPs and MINLPs in various branches of engineering, power systems, and control theory.
