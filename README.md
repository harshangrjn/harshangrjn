### [Harsha Nagarajan](http://harshanagarajan.com)

I'm a staff scientist at the [Applied Mathematics and Plasma Physics](https://www.lanl.gov/org/ddste/aldsc/theoretical/applied-mathematics-plasma-physics/index.php) group in [Los Alamos National Laboratory](https://www.lanl.gov) (LANL). I am also part of the [Advanced Network Science Initiative](https://lanl-ansi.github.io) at LANL. 
I'm interested in development of efficient formulations and algorithms for modeling, design and control of complex physical systems. I also work on applications of MILPs and MINLPs in various branches of engineering, power systems, and control theory.

As part of my research projects, I am working on various open-source packages, mostly in computational optimization. [Julia language](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/) and [JuMP](https://jump.dev) are the basis for most of my projects. Here are a few packages which I am currently working on: 
1. [Alpine.jl](https://github.com/lanl-ansi/Alpine.jl): A Julia-based novel global optimization solver for non-convex MINLPs.
2. [QuantumCircuitOpt.jl](https://github.com/harshangrjn/QuantumCircuitOpt.jl): A Julia/JuMP-based Package for optimal quantum circuit design based on discrete optimization methods. 
3. [LaplacianOpt.jl](https://github.com/harshangrjn/LaplacianOpt.jl): A Julia/JuMP-based Package for maximizing [algebraic connectivity](https://dml.cz/bitstream/handle/10338.dmlcz/101168/CzechMathJ_23-1973-2_11.pdf) of undirected weighted graphs.
